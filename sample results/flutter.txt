DescriptionThe application developed by flutter cannot get screen long picture Expected results:‚ÄúÊà™ÈïøÂ±è‚Äù Button disabled Phone InfoActual results:‚ÄúÊà™ÈïøÂ±è‚Äù Button can be clickable Problem:I am trying to implement nested TabBarView and succeed in doing so However I am not quite sure th 'clean' way to write Flutter code Everything works well if I just put all widget in one state class To be more modular I separate inner TabBarView from outer TabBarView However I discover that innerTabController must reside in outer TabBarView class in order for inner TabBarView to recover its previous index correctly I consider th as bad code as my outer TabBarView will need to concern about inner TabBarView details (length initialIndex )Question:How should I structure code to make it more clean/maintainable/modular? Or should I use other method to retain index of inner TabView?Code: #GOALI want Flutter Stepper with it's list of steps in Header scrollable #ISSUEBut I'm getting th with th code please see attached picture #EffortI saw in Stepper Class that Row widget not scrollable I tried to change it to ListView but it's breaks everything #HopeI hope that Flutter community will be reactive to help me go further Th mistake happens I work on th project and I have th error try to solve it in many ways But not work manuallyI have to call Model in th class and I want to put value from another screen can anyone help meth error when I run project and open th screen I want to implement th layout in FlutterI did following stepsI create stateful widget Added gridview count widget to show selected images on screen Added widget that contains add button to list that will be returned by gridview to ensure that it will be last item in list of images when I clicked on add button I selected an image from gallery and insert it to beginning of list inside setState method to rerender widget when list changes images added to list successfully but newly added images have not appeared on screen code expected resultwhen user clicks add button selected images must be added to beginning and add button must move to end each time I added new image " Cloud Firestore Override deprecated API "Error occurs when building flutter application / /flutter_linux_v1 8+hotfix 4-stable/flutter/ pub-cache/hosted/pub dartlang org/tflite-1 4/android/src/main/java/sq/flutter/tflite/TflitePlugin java uses unchecked or unsafe operations Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details I am continuously getting th error and i have tried all version of Tflite till 0 but still getting same error [!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 0 3)‚Ä¢ Android SDK \Android\sdk ‚Ä¢ Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support) ‚Ä¢ Platform android-27 build-tools 0 ‚Ä¢ Jav binary at: C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jre\bin\java ‚Ä¢ Jav version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 8 0_152-release-1024-b02) X Android license status unknown I am getting an error with Android Sdk when I run Flutter doctor although I can still build/run on my device I was just curious on how to fix th issue I believe I have most updated version of android sdk downloaded not sure what happened because I didn't have th issue last week New IssuesAfter following several possible fixes in comments it has led to new problem I installed newer versions of android sdk P and along with new jdk10 Still not updated enough apparently C:\Flutter\flutter>C:\users\username\appdata\local\android\sdk\tools\bin\sdkmanager bat --update [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state cc(157)] Unhandled Exception: 'package:flutter/src/widgets/page_view dart': Failed assertion: line pos 7: 'positions isNotEmpty': PageController page cannot be accessed before PageView built with it [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state cc(157)] Unhandled Exception: SocketException: OS Error: Connection refused errno = address = 0 1 port = Performing hot restart Syncing files to device Redmi Note E/flutter (23513): [ERROR:flutter/shell/common/shell cc(178)] Dart Error: Can't load Kernel binary: Invalid kernel binary format version E/flutter (23513): [ERROR:flutter/shell/common/engine cc(188)] Could not prepare to run isolate E/flutter (23513): [ERROR:flutter/shell/common/engine cc(127)] Engine not prepare and launch isolate Error -32000 received from application: Could not run configuration in engine Restarted application in 185ms When i build for 1st time it's working fine but after i try to hot restart or build then th error occur what are reasons??

Problem IntroductionIn Flutter I created successfully anwith native code in Kotlin and Swift to get images stored on user's device However now that all code in one single dart file (UI and logic mixed) I tried to refactoring parts of it to new abstract classand implementation in class called I call methods in mywith help of plugin All worked fine before refactoring but now result following error:1 Error Message:2 The GalleryScreen:3 The Abstract Class4 The concrete Implementation Class5 And lastly the6 beforeRefactoring7 Problem ExplanationI am not sure if theor/andare messed up(I guess so though )or I made mistake when registering thein theget_itinstance But I use theget_it pluginnow for some time and all other references in same project work just fine Maybe there something wrong with thereferences in I saw in otherthat people usually refer to callbacks in th case but withand anI am not sure if that solution I am looking for Also I am not sure how to implement acallbackcorrectly in th case Do I need to use Stream wherecan help me?I hope someone might be able to point me into right direction?Also if you can show me solution please be so kind and explain where I was wrong I am still learner and try to understand what going on :)8 Further NoticesNext thing on agend would be refactoring Grid Item (_buildItem) into separate Widget File ^^ The Context and The ProblemI'm currently trying to create mono repo setup for my Flutter project but I think what I'm asking here applicable to other contexts In my current project I have anand afolder and I would like them to have global top-level build while also running separate builds for ideally each individual package and app itself Th way I could also know if they run in isolation get build badges and code coverages and maybe deploy packages to all in one go How I think th could be achievedWhat I think could accomplish th ide having separates inside subprojects/packages and somehow trigger them ‚Äî recursively ‚Äî from top level build Is th possible to do currently in Travis? If not there another solution to overall problem? Am I not approaching mono repo setup correctly? Maybe I need to write ruby program to make th work?3 Sample CodeTh sketch of what I imagine section to be in reality: The Context of ProblemIn my app I'm creating screen where user could see other people's ranks For that inevitably I'm going to need other users' names profile pictures etc So there way of querying that info through's authentication API? Or for example would I have to save that kind of dat in separate collection when user logs in for first time ‚Äî doesn't sound like good security practice to me How I think it would look likeI imagine workflow would look bit like this:My ide that there should be some API following example ofand which are both properties available from themethod The ContextI'm trying to make athat has some empty space at top so user can bring top cards to bottom of screen where she can easily access them with her thumb As discussed in I couldn't make th happen with regular so I switched to its parent However after adding top when I get close to collapsing it space blurs into darker shades of grey as seen in image below How can I disable th effect?2 The CodeThe `SliverAppBar I'm using so far is:I've also tried to modify my but it didn't seem to work: The ProblemHow do I make mybe able to scroll to empty space both to top and to bottom?For example I have list of custom widgets and I would like user to be able to get top card on list ‚Äî which at top of screen ‚Äî closer to h thumb by scrolling to it whilerenders top space with an empty background What I've tried so farThe basic shape of my code basic implementation of theconstructor:I've tried fiddling with some of theand also some workarounds so far:At first I thought that eitheror‚Äî maybe I have to set theparameter of? ‚Äî would do job but none of them seem to work I've also tried to do th artifially by creating emptys both on top and bottom of list and adding something like‚Äî I don't think that's how you use theproperty actually ‚Äî to make list start from second value but it didn't work The ProblemI'm trying to implement simple Facebook and Google Sign-in buttons with Firebase and Flutter however Google version acting very weird When I print theI either get errors or prior Facebook login dat When I login with Facebook my accountdoesappear on Firebase however Google login seems to do nothing Is th something I messed up in code below or some incompatibility problem with AndroidX with parts of these libraries? Something else?Also it not very clear to me if I have to put thesomewhere inside my project to make integration with Firebase work (I had to do something similar to setup Facebook Login button) The Facebook LoginI had to replacewithbecause recent versions have changed their API I've also tried to use previous versions of packages but encountered many errors (probably due to AndroidX):3 The Google LoginAgain seems to be more recent API:EditI've tried it on an Android 0 (Pie) emulator and it still doesn't work The ProblemI'm using a1dynamic to deal with exception handling for Firebase in my simple authentication package for my app In it when I receive an error from Firebase's authentication service I update theon (custom)to show user that an error occurred However apparently being run concurrently to theclause causing rebuilds to not happen synchronously with exception-handling Currently I'm usingfor basically everything but should I change to adynamic If so what's best way of doing it?1I did try usingalso The Code2 The Complete Code (Optional)The complete code bit long at th point in project but I think that what's shown below will suffice At any rate if you want to check everything out whole project available: The relevant files are:: theclass with relevant dat : fed withdat with thewidget : button that calls relevant method put into thethrough an 2 The Provider ClassI'm having to usein order to manually synchronize theand themethods ‚Äî I know I know it's very bad 3 My CustomWidgetSomething like th in app:Lastly validation button usesin anclause to trigger asynchronously The ProblemIs there way for ato start say at second () item of list of widgets?In my case ‚Äî more infoandif you're interested ‚Äî I'm trying to add some empty space at top of aso user can scroll top card closer to h thumb A workaround would be to add emptys to top and bottom of theof widgets to simulate empty space However thewill render thes on screen and user might become confused and not know that there are more cards available by simply scrolling Maybe there way of doing th with a?2 Some Template CodeI don't think that exposing code will help much because I'm just using typical but here it in case you need refresher The ProblemThefunction apparently only subcase of thefunction A use case I'm trying to solve right now to pump same widget for multiple afor multiple However how can I do th if it creates new instance inside each test?I've tried to initialize aoutside tests in buthas only private constructor:I don't quite get how Flutter team made th work but initializing ain same way they did inside thefunction isn't working for me:2 An ExampleA simple example would be to try to break down tests of Flutter demo that created with each new Flutter project from In it we could try to separate initial setup test of app from tapping action test:The ide would be to try to move theinto afunction The ProblemUsually eitheror deletingfolder works for me But recently some errors have been cached for long time and I just can't seem to be able to delete them The cleaning process also supposedly taking way longer than expected (+3s in my reasonably good computer) The reason why I say it caching error logs that essentially all of it refers to silly typo mistakes I have fixed long ago or other types of easy-to-fix mistakes For example days ago (my computer rebooted times since then) I've used angetter on an object that doesn't have it and log still there; or fact that it saying that I've used an invalid object on oneline but now there bascially nothing in that file anymore The app also builds and runs perfectly after these long error messages and if Ihot reloadorhot restartit no errors reappear I would like to share my complete error log here but good part of it has lot of personal dat It also not very relevant I think because it mostly refers to silly mistakes and typos What I've tried so farHere what I've tried so far:Manually delete thefolderRestart my IDEThese error messages appear both on(my current IDE) and UseCtrl+Shift+P+to reset Is there some hidden folder within aproject that could be caching these data? The Summary of ProblemI would like Trav CI setup that would let me runtests inside an Android and an iOS environments For th to happen I expect I somehow have to install Flutter Android and iOS in different environments What I Have So FarMost of posts I've been able to find on th topic are terribly outdated or feature incredibly complicated setups Some of those that keep on appearing in my searches are: by Yegor Jbanov Th one covers unit and widget testing () but not integration tests It's from early and Trav CI has maybe simplified its API because I've managed to make it work with only this:One resource that I've found very useful The setup there seems very complicated to me though The closest I could get to what I wanted similar to Maurice McCabe's Again th seems overcomplicated and outdated The Sketch of What I Have in MindTheandsteps in example I mentioned previously could be replaced bywiths In th way each stage would represent one sort of step Unit and Widget stages in one integration tests on Android and iOS in two others which similar to what Maurice McCabe and Flutter samples show For example:If I could create afor thetask that would also be nice in terms of organization What I wish I could doSo far mylooks ok (and simple) but given that I have only items in it I would like to bring them little bit closer together (and maybe to right) so they are more easily reached How do I do that? Is there property that does job? Maybe inside thetheme?2 A SnippetHere what it looks like right now: BackgroundI am building an Android application using flutter plugin I am attempting to import an image asset but I am getting following error messageTroubleshooting StepsInstead of troubleshooting exception in my application I decided to create newHello Worldapplication and run same import image function Unfortunately even in th boilerplate application I get same error I suspect culprit isbut I have been unsuccessful trying to solve th screenshot of my main dart file and exception I am receiving Any help greatly appreciated!

Sincere thanks i want to open new screen if an email value exist in shared preferencesi want to call email functionand get value of email function and check if it contains any valueif email() not empty then redirect to new screen I was developing flutter application using Android Studio when I found out there problem with gradle sync I recently updated Android Studio and migrated project to AndroidX (Refactor -> Migrate to Android X) and since then I always get th error while performing gradle sync I get same error using 'compile' instead of 'implementation' in myapp/build gradlefile in fact last version of Kotlin installed In particular th Error I get:Now: I read th and tried to solve it following suggestions and th what happens:Upgrade plugin to version 5 and sync project:Clicking on th suggestion I get th message:So I openandroid/build gradleand add th line in 'Dependencies' brackets in build script rule:But error keeps showing up The project 'android' may be using version of Gradle that does not contain method Open Gradle wrapper fileSo I opengradle-wrapper propertiesand th what I find in it (I don't know if there's anything wrong here)And finally th what happens when I click onThe build file may be missing Gradle plugin Apply Gradle pluginA list of plugins opens up and I really don't know which one I should implementIn addition th myapp/build gradlefile so you can read where 'implementation ()' method called Furthermore th file also present 'Cannot resolve symbol' error on 'GradleException' symbol I think th due to previous problem but I'm not sure about it I hope can land me an hand maybe it's something I'm missing Thank You ideaI'm currently trying to get an app ide to screen and started working with flutter I want to create small app with few pages The navigation from app already working way I want it to as well as headers themself I'm struggeling with content I added an image of current app to visualize issue on end of post Currently working part:if view-are isn't filled with content I'm able to swipe left or right and change to tap pages listed in menu on bottom section I want to fill view with content box generated in stateless widget As for number I don't know how many there will be (based on dat I'm getting from website in future) If there are too many boxes to fit screen view should be scrollable QuestionI got Grid List to work and be scrollable in vertical direction however when using GrindView from flutter docs I was unable to swipe left or right to change pages are there any other widgets to use to get th to work or am I missing parapeter?

BackgroundI'm JS/React dev who brand new to Dart/Flutter with bare minimum C C++ Jav and Python experience outside of my little bubble I jumped into my first Flutter app and went straight for my Dat Model trying to picture it using what I know best - JSON/JavaScript objects Now that I'm trying to convert some example dat into Flutter State to build Widgets around I'm at loss on how to represent th stuff effectively I also want to be able to Load-In and Save-Out th dat as JSON perhaps to device storage or NoSQL or Firebase backend ExampleTo describe problem I've come up with some example Bookstore dat TheHomepage of app displays list of bookstores Tapping one opens aBookstorewith all its Authors Tapping anAuthordisplays all their books and tapping aBookopens info about it The first pages allow you to Add an item (new Bookstore (from Home page) Author (from Bookstore page) or Book) The last pages all have Editors associated (Modify dat of selected Bookstore Author or Book) Also note single Book contains list of "genre" IDs which I need to hydrate before I can display them on screen Clearly Page Widgets I need: Home Bookstore Bookstore Edit Author Author Edit Book Book Edit QuestionsQuestion 1:With what strategies do I turn th JS Object blob into usable State in Dart/Flutter I've looked at Redux BLOC MobX Stateful Widgets Flutter Hooks and some Provider but none really jump out to me as obvious choices and all example increment counter nothing nested or more complex Question 2:If I'm loading Book page what's good way to Contextualize that book underWhat I'm thinking so farI can see Home page exists to select Bookstore ID Similarly Bookstore and Author pages select their value I suppose if I have all values defined I should know exactly which Book to render (and perhaps Edit) So maybe BLOC or Provider can be set up to track those values and return Page vi some routing/Navigation?But then if my Book page displayed it should (1) have all its Book dat loaded and (2) have pre-hydrated or be able to hydrate IDs referencing other dat in State Should all th dat be loaded from JSON and simply stored in some AppState variable which massive hierarchy of Objects? Because I could easily seebut I'm not sure how to tie it to Widget rerenders at that point Any guidance or advice would be immensely appreciated and set me on path for success DemonstrationExplanationImagine atreewitheither horizontal (referring to theparameter)in aor verticalin The in both cases being surrounded by two other's Here are both cases:As you might be able to understand in one of directions thewill be swiped towards it willcover up butnot in other How do I render child of mybelowall's in aorandvise versa?In thetitleI talk about"later"and"earlier" By that I mean order they appear in thebecause later they appear in it higher they will be rendered I think that th can easily be observed from my demonstration becauseone circle covered up by but not other I want to achieve thesame behavior for bothred circles Code to try: Duplicate method behaviorThewill print If I remove override i e removefrom it will printfrom Th leads me to conclusion that method "priority" If I add more mixins e g like this:Now output If I swap aroundand:Now outpt isagain Consequently I would define priority like this: QuestionIs there any way for me tocontrolth behavior i e call super call method even when ahas method with same name?WhyYou might be askin why I would want to do th and not just rename methods Well in Flutter all's have amethod and if I have athat hasmethod as well it will break the's functionality because the'smethod takes priority as illustrated above Additional noteswill call mixin method as well which why that does not work You can try adding following constructor to:Even if th worked it would not help as themethod in Flutter case called from outside EDIT -- error user not defined We have flutter app that passing user object to different screens on button press Th works great when passing to Stateless Widget I tried implementing same pattern in Stateful Widget and its not working Im assuming since Im new to flutter I am doing it wrong and stateful widget must handle th object differently Here code for stateless widget:I tried using th method of passing user object in stateful widget like so and its not working EDITI tried thisBut I get th analyzer error A value of type 'Future' can't be assigned to variable of type 'Features' Try changing type of variable or casting right-hand type to 'Features' dart(invalid_assignment)EDIT ENDI have th http call Features just an object with values HTTP CALLImplementationIm getting th error and Im not sure how to fix it It looks correct code wise We normally do these on button clicks and pass object around application but we need th to work on init type 'Future' not subtype of type 'Features' in type cast EDITIts cutting off my background gradient and not showing image I need to have layout in flutter with column of text objects to left and an image to right I found an example picture on flutter io site but they dont show code for th particular example I have column of dat formatted but cant figure out how to add image to right Here picture of what I am trying to get layout wise Here my existing code with dat we want to right of image EDITMoving code fixed issue but im getting th error now I am trying to debug an issue and my http call never hit I had to redesign wiget to make it stateful so I think I missed something Ive never done http call on screen load we

How it worksWhen we set viewportFraction view gets center aligned If viewportFraction setsHow I expectBut what I need view to start with left-aligned like how playstore dashboard works The above screenshot has taken from Google Play Store For more infoHow can I achieve this?While doing coding walkthrough I've never found way to center align it I just created new custom class by just copying thepage_viewclass i am beginner in flutter i want to use asset image in my project i created folder namedassetsand pasted image in it i just followed instructor steps and i modified thepubspecfile file was as this:i just uncommented and modified to my image path as th :when i pushed run button th error happened to me :Error detected in pubspec yaml:Error on line column 4: Expected key while parsing block mapping ‚ï∑44 ‚îÇ assets:‚îÇ ^‚ïµnote :th was first modification in thepubspecfile I am new to fultter And i want to do something like this|Textview: Editext |No thing that i use yo apply layout_weigth to both textview "0 3" and editext it "0 7" and due t that th also becomes responsive on all screen I want to do same thing on flutter Any kind of help will be appreciated Thanks I am trying to add an item to list class and then access dat of that class in another file I have an add form page and onbutton pressed I want it to add new item to list classwith title and description and location Then in my page with list_view i want to access th List and make list of widgets each using information entered Below class:and here add posts page - (unnecessary code has been removed)andin th snippet where it should be using thefunction to add an item to classBelow page where list of widgets will beI have tried importing thepage into thepage asand using function in required position withhowever it saysThank You I am trying to call th api but it shows above mentioned error It may be at some point assigning Map value to variable typed Iterable I don't know though Following Code I have written Th Ui I am trying to show dat into Th pojo I made from online pojo generator Here It in Map I am using file picker plugin to pick images I want to display picked images on screen below my code Am able to pick image name and path and display them as text in my app but unable to display them as images After I display those image then I want to upload image to firebase storage I have following situation:The main widget with Row 2 3In Row I initially set Widget AWhat I want:replace Widget A with Widget B once I have state change in Widget Ahandle replacement in Widget A and not in main Widget (so I don't want to use callbacks from Widget A or observing global state and react on it in main Widget)Replacement means: Widget B still child of main Widget (in my case stays in second row and doesn't go fullscreen as it case when you use routes/Navigator?)My reasoning for what I want:in each row of main widget user can interact with sub menue which e g in row consists of WidgetA -> [user interaction] -> WidgetB [user interaction] -> WidgetCI don't want to manage all th different states from main widgetWhat I tried:Th doesn't do job because Widget B doesn't stay in WidgetTree of main WidgetIf th not possible I would like to know what flutter way of achieving what I want :-) I want to create ( + ) button that lets user add new elements in frontend of application with its own Text and color For [ studying + violin + Running + Movies ] are create element using pop up created with (+) signbasically an On Pressed function that lets me add an element how do i write it using what?

I don't see any animation I tried to change order of container/inkwell because I saw somewhere that it creates some issue but I'm stuck Can anyone help?thanks in advance[edit 25/10]I tried out some of solutions proposed but doing so widget where th one 'nested' throw me an error writing widget where I use "CardButton" below:I'm adding here screenshot of app first with my original code second (with error) with "proposed" solution (Everything works fine with internet connection)When internet connection disconnected it returns an emptyinstead of awith It also prints error message to console:I tried thefunction or wrapping it inside try-catch block but both can not detect error (Here vastly simplified version of my issues so it's hopefully easier to understand) So on my home_screen of my app I have column with CircleTile's as children (custom widget all extracted to another file) and in each one of these CircleTile's they display number (starts at 0) and have button that increiments number The problem I have that when I press button on one of CircleTile's it only updates that CircleTile's number I want it to update all CircleTile's numbers So basically I want my custom widget to update all custom widgets values ( number) when button pressed on just one of them I can't seem to figure it out Thanks in advance for your help! I really appreciate it I'm quite new to flutter (and coding in general) so please explain well :) (I did presentation last night and had th question asked Couldn't find it on SO so I thought I'd ask and answer it myself to help others out) When running my flutter project it demanding an emulator be available but I want it to run in browser I noticed that there's an android folder and an ios folder but no web folder How do I get it to run on web? (i18n) I use setState from outside of MyApp class to change language I got th warning and don't know how to solve it (New to Flutter/Dart/Android)In console just did:Just wondering why we would want to delete project's build directory (using "flutter clean")? Does it help cure some transient Flutter problem? If so what? (Note: I want to test it on android)Hi I have an application in react native and similar application made with flutter I want to profile / test it and see cpu usage check when they drop frames etc I know that applications in debugmode are worse in performance So I thought I have to test these two applications in release mode because I dont know how much debugmode hold these applications back But from my understanding android profiling does not work in release mode (don't know about systrace still have some problems with it) So my question how do I compare these apps? Is there way to do with release builds? Or should I test and compare it with debug build?[Edit] I read that flutter has profile build which builds closely to release build running in debugmode and turning off dev mode in react-native about same? (On web as keyboard-centric developer I'm spoiled being able to press Tab key on my keyboard to advance form focus to next field )I haven't been able to figure out how to do th inside Android emulator while developing/testing my first Flutter app I have to manually move my mouse to bring focus to next form field My gut feeling that everyone has had th frustration doing their first Flutter form and there must be simple setting or easy way enable it? (sleeping sound) How to implement th type of notification in flutter Such as leading icon title subtitle trailing with play and pause button and background color? image attached in below link (th was originally post on flutter-dev reddit that was redirected here)So I started making th flutter app using firebase as backend and after looking at all options for state management I finally realised that tools provided by firebase already handle pretty much everything I would need state management for For example:I could set currently logged in user in my state to show right login or home page and make user uid available to widgets for their firestore API calls ORI can just listen toto show right page and just usefrom anywhere to get logged in user uid and do my firestore calls What I mean for every thing that would require global state I can just basically have firebase stream listener Is th right ? Or am I missing something here ? ) my goal to log in with google and take image of user and store in firebase so but i have an error during log in someone help me'?? i attach code an error Error E/flutter (11994): [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state cc(157)] Unhandled Exception: NoSuchMethodError: The method 'currentUser' was called on null E/flutter (11994): Receiver: null E/flutter (11994): Tried calling: currentUser() E/flutter (11994): #0 Object noSuchMethod (dart:core-patch/object_patch dart:53:5) E/flutter (11994): #1 checkUser (package:csf_2020/pages/login_page dart:49:11) E/flutter (11994): #2 _LoginPageState _signInButton (package:csf_2020/pages/login_page dart:102:9) E/flutter (11994): #3 _rootRun (dart:async/zone dart:1122:38) E/flutter (11994): #4 _CustomZone run (dart:async/zone dart:1023:19) E/flutter (11994): #5 _FutureListener handleWhenComplete (dart:async/future_impl dart:163:18) E/flutter (11994): #6 Future _propagateToListeners handleWhenCompleteCallback (dart:async/future_impl dart:650:39) E/flutter (11994): #7 Future _propagateToListeners (dart:async/future_impl dart:706:37) E/flutter (11994): #8 Future _completeError (dart:async/future_impl dart:532:5) E/flutter (11994): #9 _AsyncAwaitCompleter completeError (dart:async-patch/async_patch dart:38:15) E/flutter (11994): #10 signInWithGoogle (package:csf_2020/pages/login_page dart) E/flutter (11994): E/flutter (11994): #11 _LoginPageState _signInButton (package:csf_2020/pages/login_page dart:100:9) E/flutter (11994): #12 _InkResponseState _handleTap (package:flutter/src/material/ink_well dart:706:14) E/flutter (11994): #13 _InkResponseState build (package:flutter/src/material/ink_well dart:789:36) E/flutter (11994): #14 GestureRecognizer invokeCallback (package:flutter/src/gestures/recognizer dart:182:24) E/flutter (11994): #15 TapGestureRecognizer handleTapUp (package:flutter/src/gestures/tap dart:486:11) E/flutter (11994): #16 BaseTapGestureRecognizer _checkUp (package:flutter/src/gestures/tap dart:264:5) E/flutter (11994): #17 BaseTapGestureRecognizer handlePrimaryPointer (package:flutter/src/gestures/tap dart:199:7) E/flutter (11994): #18 PrimaryPointerGestureRecognizer handleEvent (package:flutter/src/gestures/recognizer dart:467:9) E/flutter (11994): #19 PointerRouter _dispatch (package:flutter/src/gestures/pointer_router dart:76:12) E/flutter (11994): #20 PointerRouter _dispatchEventToRoutes (package:flutter/src/gestures/pointer_router dart:117:9) E/flutter (11994): #21 _LinkedHashMapMixin forEach (dart:collection-patch/compact_hash dart:379:8) E/flutter (11994): #22 PointerRouter _dispatchEventToRoutes (package:flutter/src/gestures/pointer_router dart:115:18) E/flutter (11994): #23 PointerRouter route (package:flutter/src/gestures/pointer_router dart:101:7) E/flutter (11994): #24 GestureBinding handleEvent (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:218:19) E/flutter (11994): #25 GestureBinding dispatchEvent (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:198:22) E/flutter (11994): #26 GestureBinding _handlePointerEvent (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:156:7) E/flutter (11994): #27 GestureBinding _flushPointerEventQueue (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:102:7) E/flutter (11994): #28 GestureBinding _handlePointerDataPacket (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:86:7) E/flutter (11994): #29 _rootRunUnary (dart:async/zone dart:1138:13) E/flutter (11994): #30 _CustomZone runUnary (dart:async/zone dart:1031:19) E/flutter (11994): #31 _CustomZone runUnaryGuarded (dart:async/zone dart:933:7) E/flutter (11994): #32 _invoke1 (dart:ui/hooks dart:273:10) E/flutter (11994): #33 _dispatchPointerDataPacket (dart:ui/hooks dart:182:5) E/flutter (11994): * I am starting to develop in Flutter (IDE: Android Studio) and whenever I want to modify app / build gradle make mistakes inandI know it does not affect compiling application but it very annoying that app / bradle underlined in red ** I am using MultipartRequest to upload multiple images to server but backend developer told me i have to specify "category_id" field with integer value but fileds property in MultipartRequest accepts only Map here my code what should i do?** ** i have follow guide but it did not work simple console log after 'flutter run':**detail console log after 'flutter run -v':print after ** I want to update my flutter app (ios/android) programatically when new version uploaded in to google PlayStore/AppStore with in application window i need to show dialogbox Is there any packages or plugins for th ** ** update ** Fixed it by editing my server to listen on 0 0 Getting response now but still error message wasn't right it should've shown port not random port --- // ---While trying to make post request to I get th error:SocketException (SocketException: OS Error: Connection timed out errno = address = 168 9 port = 53744)The port changes on every request but never right port (3333) why that?

Hi Everyone I want screen like th ƒ± cant create dropdown button How I can Create Like Th Screen? Please Help When I try to load an image in my application it feels like it somehow not stretching properly I tried all options for "fit" parameter And nothing happenedIt's my codeWhat should I do to make image of original quality? I'm using following library as it quite new working for ios and android and actually has notification handling On android it uses android mediaplayer on ios it uses AVplayer If you're adding given example there and change list of songs which contains local and network song with network songs only and test it on real ios device I have an issue which I actually can't fix First up th my list which I replaced in demo project:and here example:If you start playing song and switch to lockscreen where medi player everything just works fine only thing you may notice that it takes quite long time until song starts playing (The plugin buffers actually) If you toggle next song icon on mediaplayer play icon stops for millisecond resumes then song still playing like 3-5 seconds before finally playing next song If you check debugging console song starts buffering later there there an error somewhere in swift code I think if you press next or previous on mediaplayer it should directly switch to next song which it actually not working right now Hopefully someone can help out! Right now in code these are separate screens but they are simply using regular built-in animation between screens Where would I even start to begin achieving an animation like mockup example? Could I use Stack that has circle as background with hero tag and then change its radius? How could I guarantee it would fill size of any screen?Thank you! please check link above to see animation The one in video made in Jav An imageView changing images using UniversalImageLoader in milliseconds interval with Handler JavaCode:Xml: Check out video to see what I'm talking about ‚§¥Before I start making custom widgets I wanted to see if anyone knew way to fix th with vanill Flutter It seems to be something related to TextEditingController but I'm not entirely sure When TextField set to centre or right align it seems to work just fine but when on left / start / justify it always seems to have that slight jitter Thanks in advance! ~ I may post th to Github repository as wellEdit: You can see that cursor jitters only when it moves to left of textfield When it moving within string it does not jitter at all I was testing th on simulated iPhone material design ofthat looks like:I'd like to make similar one with not sure if I've to start with something like below code or know and how to complete it!UPDATEI just need to start and have empty panels While following th article for running flutter on desktop I'm getting following errors:make: pkg-config: Command not foundmake: clang++: Command not foundmake: *** [/home/hachiman69/Flutter/flutter-desktop-embedding/testbed/linux/ /build/linux/obj/debug/main o] Error th my json datath my modelth my function in apiservice till now everything fine but when i try to reach my json dat like :it says:but value which comes from json dat Menu and as you can see i created my List why it happening ? i created th model class to get information from json dat when page loadedth my function to reach my dat by using menuFromJson method but now it saysThe return type 'List' isn't 'Future' as defined by method 'anaMenuListeyiAl' What should i do i don't know there someone who can help me Hi all I am new to flutter and following above guide We create four textformfields and each field will contain its own validation After that we create Raisedbutton widget that will be submit button:How do I actually do th as th only adds 1?

I used th package to check ping But it does not work correctly here my code:Here output of following code:-I/flutter ( 8390): Pinging google comThat's it No output printed about ping I think listening part not working properly I need th package because in my app I want to ping to various IP The listening part never get executed My connection status also ok The network connection fine and all features using internet are working fine But I need to ping some remote IP Using data_tables row not removing while dat removed especially in case of pagination where I define rows per page but it cant get updated while removing dat of some rows Has anyone face same issue and has anyone find any feasible solution?well I got my issue solved by replacing thiswithbecause my list length not updating and that's why rows are created but as far as I know th might be not feasible solution here I am updating _rowsPerPage when state changes at same item items length also get change but that does not make an effect on Ui lets you set custom sounds for notifications According to example those sounds need to be placed inside android/ios directories Is it possible to use sounds from assets directory or from an url? Can I use Provider to provide blocs globally to all widgets down tree without MaterialApp? I tried to provide BLoC to page but when I'm navigating to next page BloC isn't found So should I provide it whenever I'm navigating to new page or there solution to provide it globally without MaterialApp?Currently I'm doing it th wayTh approach works and all pages can access provided BLoC But if use th approachMyPage2 MyPage3 can't find provided BLoC BLoC only can be found on MyPage1 I used th package for cart and it works But when app closes cart model becomes empty What can I do for th problem?I want to save previous dat when app opened thanks helps to draft an email make call and send sms to specific recipient Is there any way to launch mail/sms apps (inbox - not draft) ? post describes very similar problem but answer there doesn't solve all problems:I have potentially long List where user can add new items (on at time) After/On add list should scroll to its end (Btw no not an option)After reading other post I understood usingshould to trick b/c new listswill be correct But it doesn't work reliably: When already scrolled to end of list or near end everything's ok But when list scrolled to its start (or some way from end) when adding new item list gets scrolled but scrollposition off by exactly one item - newest one I think it might have something to do with thenot keeping all children alive - but how to solve it?Oh and bonus question: just discovered another very strange behaviour: after adding two items last one little bit out of view but list isn't scrollable - which strange But even stranger that on next add-item-click list scrolls th tiny bit - but without ever creating new item!?Here complete example: we solved changing dialog height now how can I animate th changingof dialog Full source code: I want tosort items in model which represents firebase documents of particular collections Also th model contains document Ids of users(which will be sorted according to distance) of thecollection "users" and i will bring those documents only from "users"collection I have calculated distances from current-user to other usersand i want bring nearest users for th user I have tried following code:ScreenShot:[In pink box are whole calculation done and assigned and documents brought from firebase] []Got Error:Got th error: "Unhandled Exception: PlatformException(error Invalid Query 'in' filters cannot contain 'null' in value array null)" ‚ÄìDetailed Code:Temp model:Variables:code: i want to try solution mentioned here but i dont know how towhen app signed in debug it shows ads but not in release mode It can only copy all not part Does flutter have ready-made solution? Th requirement should be used very frequently Is there specific widget implementation? It does work well but after creating tabbarview based on categories i'm creating listview with listtile for content it does owrk as intended only problem that each listtile created as ontap wich i need bit i can only get tap from last one created how i solve th ?} } I also play withwidget anddecorationcolor of But didn't find solution It always displaywhitebackground color when I set it transparent Look at below image Instead of red color it should be transparent Below are my code: Problem same with th link however solution isn't working on my phone (LG G5) Leaving black margin around camer preview for back camer however works fine for front camer but th time recorded video will cover larger are than preview video I tried on other phones front and back camer preview works just fine but actual recorded video covering more are problem still persists Edit: Problem originates from Camer package itself not framework for anyone out there who has similar problem Further investigation and playing around with package revealed that aspect ratio value that returned from package not guaranteed to match device's aspect ratio however works fine most of cases solved question about design th layout I have problem to using that because of th curve on right of screen not widget and when I want to have some other widgets in green side I can't because designed curve not widget its clipped from green layout Suppose I want to have th curve on right of screen and some widget in below of that Source codeI want to use right curve as an widget on top of all widgets without having green side you suppose green side as has similar problem I have So what am doing that I'm also trying to make Sign in page Th what I want Code to do:User clicks Sign in button from drawer The user will have to sign in using Google Account Then user will be greeted with adding additional things to account to fully register The user taps on Submit button The screen pops and goes back to Home ScreenSo technically it should work like th Sign in Button from Home() -> Navigation push() -> RegisterPage() and when user adds h things into Text field should tap Submit button from RegisterPage() -> Navigation pop() -> Home() -> Return Values Now issue am facing on 4th Point as soon as user taps on Submit button it keeps getting me to same page The fun fact values get returned but still it shows RegisterPage() where it shouldn't be I'm using Firebase Database to store User dat so as I said values do get returned because when I check database values are entered into database issue when it Pops same RegisterPage() screen displayed rather than Home() page I've used th kind of push() and pop() before in another app where I return some values from other pages and never faced th issue maybe my code not right I don't know Here's code where am asking for dat to be returned from page: -Here's where Function createUserInFirestore called:Here's code of Navigation pop() how I want dat to be returned Here's full Home() code:Th full RegisterPage() Code: an article which says you shouldn‚Äôt surprise users with interstitial ads I have code like th to delay an ad before it appears:But that code just waits for seconds and does not depend on interstitial ad when it appears In that case if after second and if connection still slow it will remain silent How can I handle that until interstitial ad has really appeared Thanks In Language Tour of Dart docs it says "Note: Instance variables can be final but not const Final instance variables must be initialized before constructor body starts ‚Äî at variable declaration by constructor parameter or in constructor‚Äôs initializer list "But it's possible to make constant object using constant constructor Why it not possible to declare constant variable as member variable in Dart? but I am able to achieve thisby following code I have tried SliverAppBar using flexible and expanded but was not able to achieve Update- First element of list going behind text field I want to scroll only when animation completed content 1862981after while i change it while app open to 1862982it's take time to stable to why ??print result I'm implementing basic login screen in my flutter app and I'm running into pretty annoying issue My email address lastName firstName@ and without fail as soon as I type ' ' after my last name it auto capitalizes first letter I've tested it with some other names and it seems like it happens for some and not for others My text form field widget defined as:Is th just something OS controlled or it fixable?
