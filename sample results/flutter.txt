DescriptionThe application developed by flutter cannot get screen long picture Expected results:“截长屏” Button disabled Phone InfoActual results:“截长屏” Button can be clickable Problem:I am trying to implement nested TabBarView and succeed in doing so However I am not quite sure th 'clean' way to write Flutter code Everything works well if I just put all widget in one state class To be more modular I separate inner TabBarView from outer TabBarView However I discover that innerTabController must reside in outer TabBarView class in order for inner TabBarView to recover its previous index correctly I consider th as bad code as my outer TabBarView will need to concern about inner TabBarView details (length initialIndex )Question:How should I structure code to make it more clean/maintainable/modular? Or should I use other method to retain index of inner TabView?Code: #GOALI want Flutter Stepper with it's list of steps in Header scrollable #ISSUEBut I'm getting th with th code please see attached picture #EffortI saw in Stepper Class that Row widget not scrollable I tried to change it to ListView but it's breaks everything #HopeI hope that Flutter community will be reactive to help me go further Th mistake happens I work on th project and I have th error try to solve it in many ways But not work manuallyI have to call Model in th class and I want to put value from another screen can anyone help meth error when I run project and open th screen I want to implement th layout in FlutterI did following stepsI create stateful widget Added gridview count widget to show selected images on screen Added widget that contains add button to list that will be returned by gridview to ensure that it will be last item in list of images when I clicked on add button I selected an image from gallery and insert it to beginning of list inside setState method to rerender widget when list changes images added to list successfully but newly added images have not appeared on screen code expected resultwhen user clicks add button selected images must be added to beginning and add button must move to end each time I added new image " Cloud Firestore Override deprecated API "Error occurs when building flutter application / /flutter_linux_v1 8+hotfix 4-stable/flutter/ pub-cache/hosted/pub dartlang org/tflite-1 4/android/src/main/java/sq/flutter/tflite/TflitePlugin java uses unchecked or unsafe operations Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details I am continuously getting th error and i have tried all version of Tflite till 0 but still getting same error [!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 0 3)• Android SDK \Android\sdk • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support) • Platform android-27 build-tools 0 • Jav binary at: C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jre\bin\java • Jav version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 8 0_152-release-1024-b02) X Android license status unknown I am getting an error with Android Sdk when I run Flutter doctor although I can still build/run on my device I was just curious on how to fix th issue I believe I have most updated version of android sdk downloaded not sure what happened because I didn't have th issue last week New IssuesAfter following several possible fixes in comments it has led to new problem I installed newer versions of android sdk P and along with new jdk10 Still not updated enough apparently C:\Flutter\flutter>C:\users\username\appdata\local\android\sdk\tools\bin\sdkmanager bat --update [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state cc(157)] Unhandled Exception: 'package:flutter/src/widgets/page_view dart': Failed assertion: line pos 7: 'positions isNotEmpty': PageController page cannot be accessed before PageView built with it [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state cc(157)] Unhandled Exception: SocketException: OS Error: Connection refused errno = address = 0 1 port = Performing hot restart Syncing files to device Redmi Note E/flutter (23513): [ERROR:flutter/shell/common/shell cc(178)] Dart Error: Can't load Kernel binary: Invalid kernel binary format version E/flutter (23513): [ERROR:flutter/shell/common/engine cc(188)] Could not prepare to run isolate E/flutter (23513): [ERROR:flutter/shell/common/engine cc(127)] Engine not prepare and launch isolate Error -32000 received from application: Could not run configuration in engine Restarted application in 185ms When i build for 1st time it's working fine but after i try to hot restart or build then th error occur what are reasons??

Problem IntroductionIn Flutter I created successfully anwith native code in Kotlin and Swift to get images stored on user's device However now that all code in one single dart file (UI and logic mixed) I tried to refactoring parts of it to new abstract classand implementation in class called I call methods in mywith help of plugin All worked fine before refactoring but now result following error:1 Error Message:2 The GalleryScreen:3 The Abstract Class4 The concrete Implementation Class5 And lastly the6 beforeRefactoring7 Problem ExplanationI am not sure if theor/andare messed up(I guess so though )or I made mistake when registering thein theget_itinstance But I use theget_it pluginnow for some time and all other references in same project work just fine Maybe there something wrong with thereferences in I saw in otherthat people usually refer to callbacks in th case but withand anI am not sure if that solution I am looking for Also I am not sure how to implement acallbackcorrectly in th case Do I need to use Stream wherecan help me?I hope someone might be able to point me into right direction?Also if you can show me solution please be so kind and explain where I was wrong I am still learner and try to understand what going on :)8 Further NoticesNext thing on agend would be refactoring Grid Item (_buildItem) into separate Widget File ^^ The Context and The ProblemI'm currently trying to create mono repo setup for my Flutter project but I think what I'm asking here applicable to other contexts In my current project I have anand afolder and I would like them to have global top-level build while also running separate builds for ideally each individual package and app itself Th way I could also know if they run in isolation get build badges and code coverages and maybe deploy packages to all in one go How I think th could be achievedWhat I think could accomplish th ide having separates inside subprojects/packages and somehow trigger them — recursively — from top level build Is th possible to do currently in Travis? If not there another solution to overall problem? Am I not approaching mono repo setup correctly? Maybe I need to write ruby program to make th work?3 Sample CodeTh sketch of what I imagine section to be in reality: The Context of ProblemIn my app I'm creating screen where user could see other people's ranks For that inevitably I'm going to need other users' names profile pictures etc So there way of querying that info through's authentication API? Or for example would I have to save that kind of dat in separate collection when user logs in for first time — doesn't sound like good security practice to me How I think it would look likeI imagine workflow would look bit like this:My ide that there should be some API following example ofand which are both properties available from themethod The ContextI'm trying to make athat has some empty space at top so user can bring top cards to bottom of screen where she can easily access them with her thumb As discussed in I couldn't make th happen with regular so I switched to its parent However after adding top when I get close to collapsing it space blurs into darker shades of grey as seen in image below How can I disable th effect?2 The CodeThe `SliverAppBar I'm using so far is:I've also tried to modify my but it didn't seem to work: The ProblemHow do I make mybe able to scroll to empty space both to top and to bottom?For example I have list of custom widgets and I would like user to be able to get top card on list — which at top of screen — closer to h thumb by scrolling to it whilerenders top space with an empty background What I've tried so farThe basic shape of my code basic implementation of theconstructor:I've tried fiddling with some of theand also some workarounds so far:At first I thought that eitheror— maybe I have to set theparameter of? — would do job but none of them seem to work I've also tried to do th artifially by creating emptys both on top and bottom of list and adding something like— I don't think that's how you use theproperty actually — to make list start from second value but it didn't work The ProblemI'm trying to implement simple Facebook and Google Sign-in buttons with Firebase and Flutter however Google version acting very weird When I print theI either get errors or prior Facebook login dat When I login with Facebook my accountdoesappear on Firebase however Google login seems to do nothing Is th something I messed up in code below or some incompatibility problem with AndroidX with parts of these libraries? Something else?Also it not very clear to me if I have to put thesomewhere inside my project to make integration with Firebase work (I had to do something similar to setup Facebook Login button) The Facebook LoginI had to replacewithbecause recent versions have changed their API I've also tried to use previous versions of packages but encountered many errors (probably due to AndroidX):3 The Google LoginAgain seems to be more recent API:EditI've tried it on an Android 0 (Pie) emulator and it still doesn't work The ProblemI'm using a1dynamic to deal with exception handling for Firebase in my simple authentication package for my app In it when I receive an error from Firebase's authentication service I update theon (custom)to show user that an error occurred However apparently being run concurrently to theclause causing rebuilds to not happen synchronously with exception-handling Currently I'm usingfor basically everything but should I change to adynamic If so what's best way of doing it?1I did try usingalso The Code2 The Complete Code (Optional)The complete code bit long at th point in project but I think that what's shown below will suffice At any rate if you want to check everything out whole project available: The relevant files are:: theclass with relevant dat : fed withdat with thewidget : button that calls relevant method put into thethrough an 2 The Provider ClassI'm having to usein order to manually synchronize theand themethods — I know I know it's very bad 3 My CustomWidgetSomething like th in app:Lastly validation button usesin anclause to trigger asynchronously The ProblemIs there way for ato start say at second () item of list of widgets?In my case — more infoandif you're interested — I'm trying to add some empty space at top of aso user can scroll top card closer to h thumb A workaround would be to add emptys to top and bottom of theof widgets to simulate empty space However thewill render thes on screen and user might become confused and not know that there are more cards available by simply scrolling Maybe there way of doing th with a?2 Some Template CodeI don't think that exposing code will help much because I'm just using typical but here it in case you need refresher The ProblemThefunction apparently only subcase of thefunction A use case I'm trying to solve right now to pump same widget for multiple afor multiple However how can I do th if it creates new instance inside each test?I've tried to initialize aoutside tests in buthas only private constructor:I don't quite get how Flutter team made th work but initializing ain same way they did inside thefunction isn't working for me:2 An ExampleA simple example would be to try to break down tests of Flutter demo that created with each new Flutter project from In it we could try to separate initial setup test of app from tapping action test:The ide would be to try to move theinto afunction The ProblemUsually eitheror deletingfolder works for me But recently some errors have been cached for long time and I just can't seem to be able to delete them The cleaning process also supposedly taking way longer than expected (+3s in my reasonably good computer) The reason why I say it caching error logs that essentially all of it refers to silly typo mistakes I have fixed long ago or other types of easy-to-fix mistakes For example days ago (my computer rebooted times since then) I've used angetter on an object that doesn't have it and log still there; or fact that it saying that I've used an invalid object on oneline but now there bascially nothing in that file anymore The app also builds and runs perfectly after these long error messages and if Ihot reloadorhot restartit no errors reappear I would like to share my complete error log here but good part of it has lot of personal dat It also not very relevant I think because it mostly refers to silly mistakes and typos What I've tried so farHere what I've tried so far:Manually delete thefolderRestart my IDEThese error messages appear both on(my current IDE) and UseCtrl+Shift+P+to reset Is there some hidden folder within aproject that could be caching these data? The Summary of ProblemI would like Trav CI setup that would let me runtests inside an Android and an iOS environments For th to happen I expect I somehow have to install Flutter Android and iOS in different environments What I Have So FarMost of posts I've been able to find on th topic are terribly outdated or feature incredibly complicated setups Some of those that keep on appearing in my searches are: by Yegor Jbanov Th one covers unit and widget testing () but not integration tests It's from early and Trav CI has maybe simplified its API because I've managed to make it work with only this:One resource that I've found very useful The setup there seems very complicated to me though The closest I could get to what I wanted similar to Maurice McCabe's Again th seems overcomplicated and outdated The Sketch of What I Have in MindTheandsteps in example I mentioned previously could be replaced bywiths In th way each stage would represent one sort of step Unit and Widget stages in one integration tests on Android and iOS in two others which similar to what Maurice McCabe and Flutter samples show For example:If I could create afor thetask that would also be nice in terms of organization What I wish I could doSo far mylooks ok (and simple) but given that I have only items in it I would like to bring them little bit closer together (and maybe to right) so they are more easily reached How do I do that? Is there property that does job? Maybe inside thetheme?2 A SnippetHere what it looks like right now: BackgroundI am building an Android application using flutter plugin I am attempting to import an image asset but I am getting following error messageTroubleshooting StepsInstead of troubleshooting exception in my application I decided to create newHello Worldapplication and run same import image function Unfortunately even in th boilerplate application I get same error I suspect culprit isbut I have been unsuccessful trying to solve th screenshot of my main dart file and exception I am receiving Any help greatly appreciated!

BackgroundI'm JS/React dev who brand new to Dart/Flutter with bare minimum C C++ Jav and Python experience outside of my little bubble I jumped into my first Flutter app and went straight for my Dat Model trying to picture it using what I know best - JSON/JavaScript objects Now that I'm trying to convert some example dat into Flutter State to build Widgets around I'm at loss on how to represent th stuff effectively I also want to be able to Load-In and Save-Out th dat as JSON perhaps to device storage or NoSQL or Firebase backend ExampleTo describe problem I've come up with some example Bookstore dat TheHomepage of app displays list of bookstores Tapping one opens aBookstorewith all its Authors Tapping anAuthordisplays all their books and tapping aBookopens info about it The first pages allow you to Add an item (new Bookstore (from Home page) Author (from Bookstore page) or Book) The last pages all have Editors associated (Modify dat of selected Bookstore Author or Book) Also note single Book contains list of "genre" IDs which I need to hydrate before I can display them on screen Clearly Page Widgets I need: Home Bookstore Bookstore Edit Author Author Edit Book Book Edit QuestionsQuestion 1:With what strategies do I turn th JS Object blob into usable State in Dart/Flutter I've looked at Redux BLOC MobX Stateful Widgets Flutter Hooks and some Provider but none really jump out to me as obvious choices and all example increment counter nothing nested or more complex Question 2:If I'm loading Book page what's good way to Contextualize that book underWhat I'm thinking so farI can see Home page exists to select Bookstore ID Similarly Bookstore and Author pages select their value I suppose if I have all values defined I should know exactly which Book to render (and perhaps Edit) So maybe BLOC or Provider can be set up to track those values and return Page vi some routing/Navigation?But then if my Book page displayed it should (1) have all its Book dat loaded and (2) have pre-hydrated or be able to hydrate IDs referencing other dat in State Should all th dat be loaded from JSON and simply stored in some AppState variable which massive hierarchy of Objects? Because I could easily seebut I'm not sure how to tie it to Widget rerenders at that point Any guidance or advice would be immensely appreciated and set me on path for success DemonstrationExplanationImagine atreewitheither horizontal (referring to theparameter)in aor verticalin The in both cases being surrounded by two other's Here are both cases:As you might be able to understand in one of directions thewill be swiped towards it willcover up butnot in other How do I render child of mybelowall's in aorandvise versa?In thetitleI talk about"later"and"earlier" By that I mean order they appear in thebecause later they appear in it higher they will be rendered I think that th can easily be observed from my demonstration becauseone circle covered up by but not other I want to achieve thesame behavior for bothred circles Code to try: Duplicate method behaviorThewill print If I remove override i e removefrom it will printfrom Th leads me to conclusion that method "priority" If I add more mixins e g like this:Now output If I swap aroundand:Now outpt isagain Consequently I would define priority like this: QuestionIs there any way for me tocontrolth behavior i e call super call method even when ahas method with same name?WhyYou might be askin why I would want to do th and not just rename methods Well in Flutter all's have amethod and if I have athat hasmethod as well it will break the's functionality because the'smethod takes priority as illustrated above Additional noteswill call mixin method as well which why that does not work You can try adding following constructor to:Even if th worked it would not help as themethod in Flutter case called from outside EDIT -- error user not defined We have flutter app that passing user object to different screens on button press Th works great when passing to Stateless Widget I tried implementing same pattern in Stateful Widget and its not working Im assuming since Im new to flutter I am doing it wrong and stateful widget must handle th object differently Here code for stateless widget:I tried using th method of passing user object in stateful widget like so and its not working EDITI tried thisBut I get th analyzer error A value of type 'Future' can't be assigned to variable of type 'Features' Try changing type of variable or casting right-hand type to 'Features' dart(invalid_assignment)EDIT ENDI have th http call Features just an object with values HTTP CALLImplementationIm getting th error and Im not sure how to fix it It looks correct code wise We normally do these on button clicks and pass object around application but we need th to work on init type 'Future' not subtype of type 'Features' in type cast EDITIts cutting off my background gradient and not showing image I need to have layout in flutter with column of text objects to left and an image to right I found an example picture on flutter io site but they dont show code for th particular example I have column of dat formatted but cant figure out how to add image to right Here picture of what I am trying to get layout wise Here my existing code with dat we want to right of image EDITMoving code fixed issue but im getting th error now I am trying to debug an issue and my http call never hit I had to redesign wiget to make it stateful so I think I missed something Ive never done http call on screen load we normally do them in button click Here code:HTTP CALLNo breakpoints are getting hit at all ExplanationI'm attempting to build default app created after runningand keep getting gradle error shown below

For example stop animation when user tap on screen and scale up/down on swipe up/down?Simple animation library was only an example i'm just searching way to accomplish th result Thanks ProjectHi I was playing around with bouncing scroll physics in flutter trying to achieve specific behaviour Here simple mockupBouncingScrollPhysics in flutter create th overscroll effect on top of listview adding some space in relation to user scroll QuestionIs it possible to extend th behaviour also to spacing between list view elements? I noticed th kind of behaviour in some ios apps lately and i wanted to understand if th achievable in flutter Hope someone can help with th it's really cool effect Thanks ProjectHi I was trying to build simple list in flutter with my custom constroller and listener Here codeProblemMy code works as intented but i'm trying to detect user swipes even when there nothing to swipe So far if list overflows screen when user swipe scroll listener called but when list of items shorter than screen size th does not happend How can i force listener to always listen? ProjectHi I'm attempting to recreate th kind of effect in flutterbut I'm unable to find good way of doing it I want also simple slide animation between two states My way of doing it was to wrap two AnimatedContainer into column ( upper container has fixed height while bottom one expanded) but I'm having some problems with overflowing and gesturescode}QuestionIs there better way of doing it handling also overflow while container resizing?Thanks ProjectHi I'm learning how to usein Flutter I was able to add and remove elements to list with a:CodeNow I cannot understand how I can add custom curve to th transition Is th possibile? ProjectHi I'm trying to make some custom transition in flutter between two simple screen My goal to useto call another second screen on top of first one My problem that I want second screen to be only half size of height of device The rest of screen should only display old page maybe with some kind of blur I'm searching for BottomSheet style effect but without using actual widget ProblemNo matter what I try when called new screen will always be resized to fill entire screen and I'm unable to get smaller scaffold on top with some transparency to hide old page Thanks ProjectHi I'm trying to use bloc pattern to create list view that can be filtered by aHere mycodebloc:viewProblemI've read some other discussion about bloc pattern and List view but issue I'm facing here different Every time my Filter event called bloc correctly generate newbut whenrebuild my UI listview not correctly updated The new filtered list rendered but old results do not disappear It seems like new list simply stacked on top of old one In order to understand what was happening I tried printing list that has to be rendered inside BlocBuilder before build method called The printed result was correct In console I see only new filtered elements while in UI I see both new one and old one one below other What am I missing here?Thanks ProjectHi I'm trying to use th layout in flutterI want top container to be set with an initial size and then let h dimension be controlled by streamCodeProblem that th will never work in flutter because I have to provide an height to column's children and in th case stream builder doesn't have one I've already tried as soomeone suggested in other post to wrap stream builder in flexible widget and usebut that was not solution for me and leaded to th result:Is there solution? Thanks ProjectHi I have created with flutter simple app that changes height of container with streambuilder based on user vertical drag So because user input updates are very fast th force streambuider to rebuild multiple times creating effect of an animation CodeProblemDespite code working as intended I keep thinking that th not good solution because it forces UI to rebuild an unpredictable amount of time in second maybe even beyond times exceeding display refresh rate Is there better way? ProjectHi I recently discovered flutter bloc and now I'm trying to understand how exactly th works My goal to separate logic from widget classes in order to easily manage my projects ProblemI'm stuck with something that very simple using classic setState but I was trying to achieve th with bloc Here an old widget of mineIs it possible to control _opacity and _currentTitle from bloc? Something like this:I am trying to avoid buiding different state for each possible title that would be messThanks ProjectHi I was trying to align some widgets inside Stack in Flutter My end result was something like:I know that th can be easily achieved with Row but I want to animate position ot two children so I'm forced to use stack My problem simple:Example codeTh will not render as I expected No matter what I put in thefield:andwill always place child to center left The problem solved only if I give fixed width to wrapping container Now I understand why th happend but what if I want container to be size of h childrens? Label dynamic text so h width unpredictable for meAny ideas?Thanks ProjectHi I'm struggling within Flutter What I want to do extremely simple: get vertical drag distance of an user input I managed to do th with th sample codeProblemProblem that I want to detect when user finger leaves screen in order to reset scrolled Usingwon't do trick beacause it's fired even when user stop scrolling and finger still on display So I started to analise behaviour of other allcallbacks searching for some solution but evendo sameWhat am I missing? Thanks ProjectHi I'm trying to reproduce th concept in flutter:Creating two states preatty simple point I'm missing how I can transition between two with simple slide transition of some similar effectCodeI was thinking to reproduce first one with something like:and second one maybe with list viewWith th approach only thing I can do to animate transition using an animated switcher wich i think isn't good solution Is there better way to achieve result?Thanks Question:I havein myand I wann know how many items I can safely put in there before theoverflows Screenshot:Code: QuestionHi how can I implement custom multi selection widget in flutter? Here an example :I have list of widget created with ListView builder and I simply want to change color based on userTap How can I implement this? I'm able to change color when user tap on one option but then when another button tapped I can't understand how to reverse state of old selected option I was searching for solution with flutter standard state management or maybe with bloc library example codeThanks QuestionHi I was searching solution to allow user scroll on list even when there insufficient content Looking throght Flutter documentation i found th pageAs documentation saidTo force scroll view to always be scrollable even if there insufficient content as if primary was true but without necessarily setting it to true provide an AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics physics object as in:so I tried to run simple code an detect user scroll even when there isn't enough contentcodeWhy th isn't working?editHere design i'm looking forwardI have list that dynamically created I want to be able to detect user vertical swipes on that list even if there no scroll because there aren't enough element to overflow screen height On scrollable list I can simply add scroll Listener and then every time scroll detected I can do my logic with scrollController position info's I want scroll listener to be called even when user swipes on list of th type QuestionI was searching on dribble for some animation when I saw th post:In concept there list of an element with custom scroll effect It's possible to replicate that effect with flutter? Can th be achieved with some sort of custom physics? Looking through theI wasn't able to understand if ScrollPhysics can help me with thatThanks Seems to be more severe bug with flutte google maps Is duplicate ofUpdate 8th August: Current Progress:Tried to fix bug with Sukhi but he wasn't able to reproduce bug My colleagues all were able to reproduce it but wheren't able to fix it :P Did anyone else manage to reproduce it?Also created aand updated "what I tried so far"Updated on 5th August getting closer to real problemExplanation of Problem:My problem only occurs onIOsonreal devices(not Simulator) ondebugandrelease I do use google Maps widget with some markers Tapping on on Marker opens another Screen with more Information another google Maps widget and possibility to Navigate vi url launcher (I reduced Screens to only show widgets causing problem)Leaving app from th screen (by tapping start navigation for example or going to IOs homescreen) and then comming back to app leads to an issue If i go back to App homescreen again only white screen shown Addition:Wrapping Google Maps Widget in info Screen in Flex Widget (Column or Row) even leads to worse behaviour When returning to Apps HomeScreen additional content of Flex Widget (for example Container with Text) will stay visible What I tried so far to get it to work but didn't work:Release Mode => Same ProblemDisabled Navigation Transition ()async await url launchBuilding on IOs 3 & 4Building Maps Widget inside Future BuilderSteps to reproduce:Installand(I know it not latest but thats not problem)Copy CodeSnippet in flutter project and build on IOs Tap on MarkerTap on Button "Start Navigation" or leave AppTap in Apple Maps on upper left corner redirecting to App or reopen AppYour back in info screen tap on left Arrow in upper left cornerOnly white screen visibleCode:flutter doctor: SetupIn main-class of flutter app:You can setbrightness to dark or light (I think only from Android OS 0 API onward) you can choose in your device settings screen-tone (light | dark) Example (OP7 pro)Settings > Customisation > Tone > Colourful | Light |DarkWhen in dark-mode and opening some apps (chrome for example) app set to dark Opening other apps th doesn't happen Question:1) Does your app brightness dynamically update based on device tone-settings if you don't set anybrightness?(Can't test th myself atm)2) If not how could you dynamically changebrightness based on device screen tone-setting?

Or drawing itself?How would I go about th in general? What am I doing wrong? How should I store these pixels instead EffortsI have tried so much that did not help at all that I will try to only point out most notable ones:I tried converting theto anhoping to use In order to do that I tried encoding my own PNG but However it did not look like that would boost performance When trying to convert aimage I ran into an out of memory exception Now I am wondering how video rendered as all as any 4k video will easily take up more memory than aimage if few seconds of it are in memory I tried implementing thepackage However I stopped before completing it as I noticed that it not meant to be used in Flutter but rather in HTML I would not have gained anything using that Th one pretty important for following conclusion I will draw: I tried tojust drawwithout storing pixels i e usingto generate random colors When trying to randomly generate aimage th resulted in aGPU maxofand aUI maxof which even worse especially in GPU department ConclusionTh conclusion I reached before trying my failed attempt at rendering using: not made for th task as it cannot even draw simple images How do you do th in Flutter?NotesTh basically(yes I have been trying to resolve th issue for that long) but I think that I did not express myself properly back then and that I knew even less what actual problem was The highest resolution I can properly render aroundpixels I need at least I am thinking that abandoning Flutter and going for native might be my only option However I would like to believe that I am just approaching th problem completely wrong I have spent about three months trying to figure th out and I did not find anything that lead me anywhere What am I doing?I have native iOS app I wrote Flutter module for new feature and integrated it into current native app In order to use cool Flutter features like I launched native app in an iOS Simulator then I open my Flutter project folder in myand ranto attach Flutter debugger to native app as I opened thescreen then it was connected and whenever I make change in Flutter code I can hitto trigger hot reload to see update on screen What problem?I wanted to debug some code so I put some breakpoints then I triggered hot reload to run code which refreshes UI UI was refreshed but none of my breakpoints was triggered Question:Why hadn't these breakpoints been triggered? If I can not use breakpoints how can I debug something like th under th situation?Thanks!

I don't see any animation I tried to change order of container/inkwell because I saw somewhere that it creates some issue but I'm stuck Can anyone help?thanks in advance[edit 25/10]I tried out some of solutions proposed but doing so widget where th one 'nested' throw me an error writing widget where I use "CardButton" below:I'm adding here screenshot of app first with my original code second (with error) with "proposed" solution (Everything works fine with internet connection)When internet connection disconnected it returns an emptyinstead of awith It also prints error message to console:I tried thefunction or wrapping it inside try-catch block but both can not detect error (Here vastly simplified version of my issues so it's hopefully easier to understand) So on my home_screen of my app I have column with CircleTile's as children (custom widget all extracted to another file) and in each one of these CircleTile's they display number (starts at 0) and have button that increiments number The problem I have that when I press button on one of CircleTile's it only updates that CircleTile's number I want it to update all CircleTile's numbers So basically I want my custom widget to update all custom widgets values ( number) when button pressed on just one of them I can't seem to figure it out Thanks in advance for your help! I really appreciate it I'm quite new to flutter (and coding in general) so please explain well :) (I did presentation last night and had th question asked Couldn't find it on SO so I thought I'd ask and answer it myself to help others out) When running my flutter project it demanding an emulator be available but I want it to run in browser I noticed that there's an android folder and an ios folder but no web folder How do I get it to run on web? (i18n) I use setState from outside of MyApp class to change language I got th warning and don't know how to solve it (New to Flutter/Dart/Android)In console just did:Just wondering why we would want to delete project's build directory (using "flutter clean")? Does it help cure some transient Flutter problem? If so what? (Note: I want to test it on android)Hi I have an application in react native and similar application made with flutter I want to profile / test it and see cpu usage check when they drop frames etc I know that applications in debugmode are worse in performance So I thought I have to test these two applications in release mode because I dont know how much debugmode hold these applications back But from my understanding android profiling does not work in release mode (don't know about systrace still have some problems with it) So my question how do I compare these apps? Is there way to do with release builds? Or should I test and compare it with debug build?[Edit] I read that flutter has profile build which builds closely to release build running in debugmode and turning off dev mode in react-native about same? (On web as keyboard-centric developer I'm spoiled being able to press Tab key on my keyboard to advance form focus to next field )I haven't been able to figure out how to do th inside Android emulator while developing/testing my first Flutter app I have to manually move my mouse to bring focus to next form field My gut feeling that everyone has had th frustration doing their first Flutter form and there must be simple setting or easy way enable it? (sleeping sound) How to implement th type of notification in flutter Such as leading icon title subtitle trailing with play and pause button and background color? image attached in below link (th was originally post on flutter-dev reddit that was redirected here)So I started making th flutter app using firebase as backend and after looking at all options for state management I finally realised that tools provided by firebase already handle pretty much everything I would need state management for For example:I could set currently logged in user in my state to show right login or home page and make user uid available to widgets for their firestore API calls ORI can just listen toto show right page and just usefrom anywhere to get logged in user uid and do my firestore calls What I mean for every thing that would require global state I can just basically have firebase stream listener Is th right ? Or am I missing something here ? ) my goal to log in with google and take image of user and store in firebase so but i have an error during log in someone help me'?? i attach code an error Error E/flutter (11994): [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state cc(157)] Unhandled Exception: NoSuchMethodError: The method 'currentUser' was called on null E/flutter (11994): Receiver: null E/flutter (11994): Tried calling: currentUser() E/flutter (11994): #0 Object noSuchMethod (dart:core-patch/object_patch dart:53:5) E/flutter (11994): #1 checkUser (package:csf_2020/pages/login_page dart:49:11) E/flutter (11994): #2 _LoginPageState _signInButton (package:csf_2020/pages/login_page dart:102:9) E/flutter (11994): #3 _rootRun (dart:async/zone dart:1122:38) E/flutter (11994): #4 _CustomZone run (dart:async/zone dart:1023:19) E/flutter (11994): #5 _FutureListener handleWhenComplete (dart:async/future_impl dart:163:18) E/flutter (11994): #6 Future _propagateToListeners handleWhenCompleteCallback (dart:async/future_impl dart:650:39) E/flutter (11994): #7 Future _propagateToListeners (dart:async/future_impl dart:706:37) E/flutter (11994): #8 Future _completeError (dart:async/future_impl dart:532:5) E/flutter (11994): #9 _AsyncAwaitCompleter completeError (dart:async-patch/async_patch dart:38:15) E/flutter (11994): #10 signInWithGoogle (package:csf_2020/pages/login_page dart) E/flutter (11994): E/flutter (11994): #11 _LoginPageState _signInButton (package:csf_2020/pages/login_page dart:100:9) E/flutter (11994): #12 _InkResponseState _handleTap (package:flutter/src/material/ink_well dart:706:14) E/flutter (11994): #13 _InkResponseState build (package:flutter/src/material/ink_well dart:789:36) E/flutter (11994): #14 GestureRecognizer invokeCallback (package:flutter/src/gestures/recognizer dart:182:24) E/flutter (11994): #15 TapGestureRecognizer handleTapUp (package:flutter/src/gestures/tap dart:486:11) E/flutter (11994): #16 BaseTapGestureRecognizer _checkUp (package:flutter/src/gestures/tap dart:264:5) E/flutter (11994): #17 BaseTapGestureRecognizer handlePrimaryPointer (package:flutter/src/gestures/tap dart:199:7) E/flutter (11994): #18 PrimaryPointerGestureRecognizer handleEvent (package:flutter/src/gestures/recognizer dart:467:9) E/flutter (11994): #19 PointerRouter _dispatch (package:flutter/src/gestures/pointer_router dart:76:12) E/flutter (11994): #20 PointerRouter _dispatchEventToRoutes (package:flutter/src/gestures/pointer_router dart:117:9) E/flutter (11994): #21 _LinkedHashMapMixin forEach (dart:collection-patch/compact_hash dart:379:8) E/flutter (11994): #22 PointerRouter _dispatchEventToRoutes (package:flutter/src/gestures/pointer_router dart:115:18) E/flutter (11994): #23 PointerRouter route (package:flutter/src/gestures/pointer_router dart:101:7) E/flutter (11994): #24 GestureBinding handleEvent (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:218:19) E/flutter (11994): #25 GestureBinding dispatchEvent (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:198:22) E/flutter (11994): #26 GestureBinding _handlePointerEvent (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:156:7) E/flutter (11994): #27 GestureBinding _flushPointerEventQueue (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:102:7) E/flutter (11994): #28 GestureBinding _handlePointerDataPacket (package:flutter/src/gestures/binding dart:86:7) E/flutter (11994): #29 _rootRunUnary (dart:async/zone dart:1138:13) E/flutter (11994): #30 _CustomZone runUnary (dart:async/zone dart:1031:19) E/flutter (11994): #31 _CustomZone runUnaryGuarded (dart:async/zone dart:933:7) E/flutter (11994): #32 _invoke1 (dart:ui/hooks dart:273:10) E/flutter (11994): #33 _dispatchPointerDataPacket (dart:ui/hooks dart:182:5) E/flutter (11994): * I am starting to develop in Flutter (IDE: Android Studio) and whenever I want to modify app / build gradle make mistakes inandI know it does not affect compiling application but it very annoying that app / bradle underlined in red ** I am using MultipartRequest to upload multiple images to server but backend developer told me i have to specify "category_id" field with integer value but fileds property in MultipartRequest accepts only Map here my code what should i do?** ** i have follow guide but it did not work simple console log after 'flutter run':**detail console log after 'flutter run -v':print after ** I want to update my flutter app (ios/android) programatically when new version uploaded in to google PlayStore/AppStore with in application window i need to show dialogbox Is there any packages or plugins for th ** ** update ** Fixed it by editing my server to listen on 0 0 Getting response now but still error message wasn't right it should've shown port not random port --- // ---While trying to make post request to I get th error:SocketException (SocketException: OS Error: Connection timed out errno = address = 168 9 port = 53744)The port changes on every request but never right port (3333) why that?

Hi Everyone I want screen like th ı cant create dropdown button How I can Create Like Th Screen? Please Help When I try to load an image in my application it feels like it somehow not stretching properly I tried all options for "fit" parameter And nothing happenedIt's my codeWhat should I do to make image of original quality? I'm using following library as it quite new working for ios and android and actually has notification handling On android it uses android mediaplayer on ios it uses AVplayer If you're adding given example there and change list of songs which contains local and network song with network songs only and test it on real ios device I have an issue which I actually can't fix First up th my list which I replaced in demo project:and here example:If you start playing song and switch to lockscreen where medi player everything just works fine only thing you may notice that it takes quite long time until song starts playing (The plugin buffers actually) If you toggle next song icon on mediaplayer play icon stops for millisecond resumes then song still playing like 3-5 seconds before finally playing next song If you check debugging console song starts buffering later there there an error somewhere in swift code I think if you press next or previous on mediaplayer it should directly switch to next song which it actually not working right now Hopefully someone can help out! Right now in code these are separate screens but they are simply using regular built-in animation between screens Where would I even start to begin achieving an animation like mockup example? Could I use Stack that has circle as background with hero tag and then change its radius? How could I guarantee it would fill size of any screen?Thank you! please check link above to see animation The one in video made in Jav An imageView changing images using UniversalImageLoader in milliseconds interval with Handler JavaCode:Xml: Check out video to see what I'm talking about ⤴Before I start making custom widgets I wanted to see if anyone knew way to fix th with vanill Flutter It seems to be something related to TextEditingController but I'm not entirely sure When TextField set to centre or right align it seems to work just fine but when on left / start / justify it always seems to have that slight jitter Thanks in advance! ~ I may post th to Github repository as wellEdit: You can see that cursor jitters only when it moves to left of textfield When it moving within string it does not jitter at all I was testing th on simulated iPhone material design ofthat looks like:I'd like to make similar one with not sure if I've to start with something like below code or know and how to complete it!UPDATEI just need to start and have empty panels While following th article for running flutter on desktop I'm getting following errors:make: pkg-config: Command not foundmake: clang++: Command not foundmake: *** [/home/hachiman69/Flutter/flutter-desktop-embedding/testbed/linux/ /build/linux/obj/debug/main o] Error th my json datath my modelth my function in apiservice till now everything fine but when i try to reach my json dat like :it says:but value which comes from json dat Menu and as you can see i created my List why it happening ? i created th model class to get information from json dat when page loadedth my function to reach my dat by using menuFromJson method but now it saysThe return type 'List' isn't 'Future' as defined by method 'anaMenuListeyiAl' What should i do i don't know there someone who can help me Hi all I am new to flutter and following above guide We create four textformfields and each field will contain its own validation After that we create Raisedbutton widget that will be submit button:How do I actually do th as th only adds 1? Where do I add others within th widget Sorry for noob questionThank you in advance I am using th Json file but when I try to decode it shows null I have tried'''''' I try to upload Image using th lib in flutter to Amazon S3 but not working any solution?but nothing return in log even no any error I updated my info plist and my app registered on facebook developer withas OAuth redirect URL but I got th MissingPluginException After looking it up suggested addingTh got rid of error but flutter_facebook_connect still not working Is there something I could be missing? I used th package to check ping But it does not work correctly here my code:Here output of following code:-I/flutter ( 8390): Pinging google comThat's it No output printed about ping I think listening part not working properly I need th package because in my app I want to ping to various IP The listening part never get executed My connection status also ok The network connection fine and all features using internet are working fine But I need to ping some remote IP Using data_tables row not removing while dat removed especially in case of pagination where I define rows per page but it cant get updated while removing dat of some rows Has anyone face same issue and has anyone find any feasible solution?well I got my issue solved by replacing thiswithbecause my list length not updating and that's why rows are created but as far as I know th might be not feasible solution here I am updating _rowsPerPage when state changes at same item items length also get change but that does not make an effect on Ui lets you set custom sounds for notifications According to example those sounds need to be placed inside android/ios directories Is it possible to use sounds from assets directory or from an url? Can I use Provider to provide blocs globally to all widgets down tree without MaterialApp? I tried to provide BLoC to page but when I'm navigating to next page BloC isn't found So should I provide it whenever I'm navigating to new page or there solution to provide it globally without MaterialApp?Currently I'm doing it th wayTh approach works and all pages can access provided BLoC But if use th approachMyPage2 MyPage3 can't find provided BLoC BLoC only can be found on MyPage1 I used th package for cart and it works But when app closes cart model becomes empty What can I do for th problem?I want to save previous dat when app opened thanks helps to draft an email make call and send sms to specific recipient Is there any way to launch mail/sms apps (inbox - not draft) ? post describes very similar problem but answer there doesn't solve all problems:I have potentially long List where user can add new items (on at time) After/On add list should scroll to its end (Btw no not an option)After reading other post I understood usingshould to trick b/c new listswill be correct But it doesn't work reliably: When already scrolled to end of list or near end everything's ok But when list scrolled to its start (or some way from end) when adding new item list gets scrolled but scrollposition off by exactly one item - newest one I think it might have something to do with thenot keeping all children alive - but how to solve it?Oh and bonus question: just discovered another very strange behaviour: after adding two items last one little bit out of view but list isn't scrollable - which strange But even stranger that on next add-item-click list scrolls th tiny bit - but without ever creating new item!?Here complete example: we solved changing dialog height now how can I animate th changingof dialog Full source code: I want tosort items in model which represents firebase documents of particular collections Also th model contains document Ids of users(which will be sorted according to distance) of thecollection "users" and i will bring those documents only from "users"collection I have calculated distances from current-user to other usersand i want bring nearest users for th user I have tried following code:ScreenShot:[In pink box are whole calculation done and assigned and documents brought from firebase] []Got Error:Got th error: "Unhandled Exception: PlatformException(error Invalid Query 'in' filters cannot contain 'null' in value array null)" –Detailed Code:Temp model:Variables:code: i want to try solution mentioned here but i dont know how towhen app signed in debug it shows ads but not in release mode It can only copy all not part Does flutter have ready-made solution? Th requirement should be used very frequently Is there specific widget implementation? It does work well but after creating tabbarview based on categories i'm creating listview with listtile for content it does owrk as intended only problem that each listtile created as ontap wich i need bit i can only get tap from last one created how i solve th ?} } I also play withwidget anddecorationcolor of But didn't find solution It always displaywhitebackground color when I set it transparent Look at below image Instead of red color it should be transparent Below are my code: Problem same with th link however solution isn't working on my phone (LG G5) Leaving black margin around camer preview for back camer however works fine for front camer but th time recorded video will cover larger are than preview video I tried on other phones front and back camer preview works just fine but actual recorded video covering more are problem still persists Edit: Problem originates from Camer package itself not framework for anyone out there who has similar problem Further investigation and playing around with package revealed that aspect ratio value that returned from package not guaranteed to match device's aspect ratio however works fine most of cases solved question about design th layout I have problem to using that because of th curve on right of screen not widget and when I want to have some other widgets in green side I can't because designed curve not widget its clipped from green layout Suppose I want to have th curve on right of screen and some widget in below of that Source codeI want to use right curve as an widget on top of all widgets without having green side you suppose green side as has similar problem I have So what am doing that I'm also trying to make Sign in page Th what I want Code to do:User clicks Sign in button from drawer The user will have to sign in using Google Account Then user will be greeted with adding additional things to account to fully register The user taps on Submit button The screen pops and goes back to Home ScreenSo technically it should work like th Sign in Button from Home() -> Navigation push() -> RegisterPage() and when user adds h things into Text field should tap Submit button from RegisterPage() -> Navigation pop() -> Home() -> Return Values Now issue am facing on 4th Point as soon as user taps on Submit button it keeps getting me to same page The fun fact values get returned but still it shows RegisterPage() where it shouldn't be I'm using Firebase Database to store User dat so as I said values do get returned because when I check database values are entered into database issue when it Pops same RegisterPage() screen displayed rather than Home() page I've used th kind of push() and pop() before in another app where I return some values from other pages and never faced th issue maybe my code not right I don't know Here's code where am asking for dat to be returned from page: -Here's where Function createUserInFirestore called:Here's code of Navigation pop() how I want dat to be returned Here's full Home() code:Th full RegisterPage() Code: an article which says you shouldn’t surprise users with interstitial ads I have code like th to delay an ad before it appears:But that code just waits for seconds and does not depend on interstitial ad when it appears In that case if after second and if connection still slow it will remain silent How can I handle that until interstitial ad has really appeared Thanks In Language Tour of Dart docs it says "Note: Instance variables can be final but not const Final instance variables must be initialized before constructor body starts — at variable declaration by constructor parameter or in constructor’s initializer list "But it's possible to make constant object using constant constructor Why it not possible to declare constant variable as member variable in Dart? but I am able to achieve thisby following code I have tried SliverAppBar using flexible and expanded but was not able to achieve Update- First element of list going behind text field I want to scroll only when animation completed content 1862981after while i change it while app open to 1862982it's take time to stable to why ??print result I'm implementing basic login screen in my flutter app and I'm running into pretty annoying issue My email address lastName firstName@ and without fail as soon as I type ' ' after my last name it auto capitalizes first letter I've tested it with some other names and it seems like it happens for some and not for others My text form field widget defined as:Is th just something OS controlled or it fixable?

I think th covariance and I think in th article it explains how to do it in c# Does Dart allow you to allow covariance somehow? will tell you whether you're running on Android or iOS How can I check which version of device OS am I running on? only set to one of them and not changingIt should set to radio selected seems to be very nice architecture for mobile app development However mobile apps have some features that are not common for web apps In my case I would like to start long polling /monitoring location/tracking file system (any action that watches some external state) after start of some particular screen and stop when screen closed Let's say we have function that can emit multiple events over time I would like to listen to function only when some particular screen active What best way of doing that? sliver that contains box widgets Is there sliver that contains sliver widgets?I am attempting to nest flutter_sticky_headers to create timeline butonly accepts single sliver as an argument (see comment in) like withsupportand that work fine when i define specific number for such asorfor th option i want to change that with screen size resolution automatically by code for example th below code can calculate screen size and can be used fororwhen i definefor libraryoption it doesn't work and only work when i press on hot reload buttonbut when i change that to specific count that work fineUPDATED:how can help me to know whats th issue and how can i fix that? catches exceptions and calls builder with It's ok in production but in dev I wann be instantly notified about all exceptions How to forceto always print exceptions stacktrace in console to prevent losing exceptions while developing My current solution towidget Do you have better ideas? rebuild whenever it get new event Th cause problem with for example navigation () because if new event receive while navigate then th trigger rebuild Because try to navigate while widget tree still being built th will throw It isto avoid th issue as required Suggested workaround basically take stream from Also:andBut th mean cannot have StreamBuilder build list which constantly update if also want to provide navigation from cards on list For example in card So to refresh dat must use pull to refresh…Anyone have better solution? Or Flutter team work on solve th limitation for example by allow prevent rebuild if card tap by user?UPDATE:TL;DR Is pull to refresh only way to update dat since stream in StreamBuilder must be cached to prevent it rebuilding every time new event received?UPDATE 2:I have try implement cache dat but my code not work: UPDATE 3:I have try usebut cannot implement correct:…UPDATE 4:Suggestion to usegive error:The getter 'stream' was called on null The method 'add' was called on null not showing image outputerrorisThe following StateError was thrown resolving single-frame picture stream:Bad state: Could not parse "currentColor" as color feature like aofimages/gifs/videos I want to achieve something like th I have parent Widget which aand it has child which athat contains theimage name anddescription if I tap image on child widget I want to show next item of Swiper / update index of Swiper Parent widget:SwiperContent widget: registers callback for when text changes Th seems to also be triggered by pressing Enter button opening/closing keyboard (changing focus) How do i register that it was enter that was pressed so i can for example invoke an API?The current way i achieve th by listening on theto detect focus change Focus removed from thewhen pressing enter and keyboard closes Is th right way to do it? has following docs:Setting th will notify all listeners of th [TextEditingController] that they need to update (it calls [notifyListeners]) For th reason th value should only be set between frames e g in response to user actions not during build layout or paint phases Th property can be set from listener added to th [TextEditingController]; however one should not also set [selection] in separate statement To change both [text] and [selection] change controller's [value] How am I supposed to update theinside amethod if I want then?Also th limitation regarding performance issues as to no lock up themethod with listeners execution? Or it something else? makes multiline TextField that DOES wrap How can I make one that does NOT wrap but still adds newline on RETURN/ENTER key ? hasproperty which defines how many lines are "painted" But what should i do when i don't know value for th property Screens are different and i just want that expanded to its maximum vertically So here i just made avalue big enough to show that it becomes so big that covers underlying Text widget If value small then small too and doesn't take whole available space How can i achieve it?I saw that lots of work has been done onrecently which hasn't been released yet: Maybe what i want to achieve will become easier after release But how can i do th now? Or there anything simple i'm missing in already released flutter? now too slow，because it doesn't start to play until download success Also it will download same video repeatedly when therebuild。So there some way to resolve th problem such as using cache? field (Number in) set as works fine returnsas expected butcrashes (exception) rather than returning which what I expected However following works: 's callback isn't being fired when I expected it to be How can I useinside aso route can handle it's own back pressed behaviour I'm learning to use flutter and I came acrossfor creating multiple pages (I know there are other navigation widgets but I'm after something which only supports programatic navigation so I can handle all UI) The next thing I thought to look at with thewas going back I foundwhich wraps component and has callback that gets called when back button pressed (if component rendered) Th seemed ideal for me since I only want callback to be called if Widget rendered I tried to usewithin awith intention for only rendered route to have it's callback () called when back button pressed but puttingwithin adoes nothing ( callback isn't called) The intention to have anavigate to top level routes and those routes themselves potentially havings so puttinginside means each route (or subroute) responsible for it's own back navigation Many questions I've looked up seem to focus on or other ways of handling navigation; I'm looking how to handle th without UI that those things bring in ( use case could be quiz app where you need to click next button to move forward or something similar) Here minimalfile I expect route to handle it's own back navigation (to keep things simple I've not put nested routes in th example) When back button pressed in either route or app exits I expect that to only be case in route and route should only log(with no navigation away from page or leaving app) From what I understand andare Widgets to use for th sort of thing but if not then how would I implement self contained (potentially nested) routes cannot containwidgets so there another way to have its children laid out according to their minimum required width but then make them fill space usingto stretch only with respect to specified?rather than generated based on bellow class What I want to achieve that ifin json file map instead of list i want it to create list and add that map into list and return it At moment it only handles list ofas it designed that way I want to keepclass as it but if map appears I want to created list and add map x g dartth stream On each event I generate streamthat itself spawns events From th set up I want to generate flattened output stream that contains only events of most recent untilends:The expected result isI can't useon because then allevents would be merged into output stream not just those of most recent sub stream I also can't usebecauseare infinite and output stream would effectively be Th seems to me like fairly common scenario hence my question: Is th possible using standard RxDart (which I'm using) or do I need to implement th myself?
